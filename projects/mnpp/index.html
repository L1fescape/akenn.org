    <p>After numerous discussions, excessive amounts of bickering, and a plethora of insults, I was convinced Apple products were a waste of money and used only by those who only knew how to browse the web and check their email.</p> 
    <p>That is until I bought one.</p>
    <p>I think I did it out of jealously at first. How could my friends have machines that took half a second to wake up from sleeping or have 5 hours of battery life? I knew if I browsed Newegg and Amazon long enough, I'd find the right machine that had everything a Macbook Pro or an Air had at half the price! But there was something missing. There always was. </p>
    <p>Long story short, I tried out a Mac, figured out what was missing (finesse), bought one, and started developing on it immediately.</p>
    <p>One of the first things I wanted to do was install Nginx. When installing Apache, I found XAMPP to be the easiest route to go since the pre-installed version of Apache, Macports, and homebrew were all giving me problems at the time. I also really liked the control tool bundled with XMPP for turning various services on and off. I wanted something similar for Nginx. After some googling, I found <a href="http://getmnpp.org/">MNPP</a> which was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
    <p>Well almost.</p>
    <p>MNPP comes with a menu bar controller for controlling Nginx, Percona, and Php but not a windowed controller like the one that comes with XAMPP. So I made one.</a>

    <div class=title>Build successful. Aww yisss.</div>
  </div>
  <div class=section>
    <p>For me, it's a nice alternative to the default control menu that comes with MNPP. It's my first Cocoa app, so there are bound to be bugs and things I can do better.</p>
