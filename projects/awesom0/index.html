          <p>
          In September of 2013 I started playing around with <a href="https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc">Node IRC</a>, an IRC client library written in NodeJS. It was dead-simple to use and really fun program to respond to my friend's messages in IRC. I let it idle in chat with a few commands at it's disposal; <code>hi</code> would say "Hi" back, <code>pugme</code> would return an image of a pug, <code>question</code> would have the bot respond with an answer to said question, <code>notes</code> for leaving people messages who weren't currently in chat, and <code>catme</code> to do the same thing as pugme but would return a cute picture of a cat instead. I also gave it the name AWESOM-0, which was inspired by an episode of South Park where Cartman pretends to be a robot in order to hear Butter's most embarrassing secrets by befriending him.
          </p>
          <p>
          Requests from co-workers and friends started coming in for more commands and options for existing commands. This meant the project needed to be re-structured. I borrowed the idea of a folder for scripts that could be enabled and disabled via a settings file from GitHub's <a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          AWESOM-0 is regularly maintained and new scripts are welcome! You can check out the bot on <a href="https://github.com/L1fescape/AWESOM-0/">GitHub</a>.
