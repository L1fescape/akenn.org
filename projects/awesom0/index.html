				<div class="section">
          <p>Recently I started playing around with <a href="https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc">Node IRC</a>, an IRC client library written in NodeJS. It's dead-simple to use and has an active community constantly adding features and supporting its growth.</p>
          <p>After toying around with it for about an hour, I'd written a few commands (heavily influenced by <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a> by the way):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>hi</code> would say "Hi" back</li>
            <li><code>pugme</code> would return an image of a pug</li>
            <li><code>question</code> would have the bot respond with an answer to said question</li>
            <li><code>notes</code> for leaving people messages who weren't currently in chat</li>
            <li><code>catme</code> to do the same thing as pugme but would return a cute picture of a cat instead</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I also gave it a name: <code>AWESOM-0</code>, inspired by an episode of South Park where Cartman pretends to be a robot.</p>
          <p>Requests from co-workers and friends started coming in for more commands and options for existing commands. This meant the project needed to be re-structured. I looked back to Hubot once again and borrowed it's concept of a folder for scripts that could be enabled and disabled via a settings file.</p>
          <p>AWESOM-0 is regularly maintained and new scripts are welcome! You can check out the bot on <a href="https://github.com/L1fescape/AWESOM-0/">GitHub</a>.</p>
