I’m 21. That number means absolutely nothing to me<sup>1</sup>. Every day there are [crazy systems](http://zachholman.com/screencast/vagranception/) made by Zach Holman or [something that saves humanity](http://www.spacex.com/index.php) from Elon Musk or [a sweet new development environment](http://www.lighttable.com/) churned out by Chris Granger. The sheer amount of content and genius that comes out of this community of passionate, hungry developers is both awe-inspiring and overwhelming. Trying or even thinking about trying to get on this level of success is terrifying due to the fact that I will either always be wrong or someone will always be better.

This won’t resolve to an epiphany I’ve had or a statement telling you what you have to do. There are enough of those.

Just know that if you’re feeling this way, you are not alone.
